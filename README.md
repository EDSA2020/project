PROJECT “PREDICTIVE MODEL”

Objective
The objective of the team is to build a predictive model that will produce the highest profit for the next direct marketing campaign of the company – the sixth campaign this year that is scheduled for next month. The campaign aims at selling a new product to the customer database (potential of 250,000 customers). To be able to build the predictive model, a pilot campaign was carried out. A sample of 2.500 customers were contacted by mail regarding the acquisition of the product. During the next 2 months, the customers who bought the offer were tagged with a 1 whereas the non-respondents were tagged with a 0. The total cost of the sample campaign was 2.500 contacts * 4€, for a total of 10.000€. Around 12.5% of Customers accepted the offer (which is quite good), each contributing with 20€ of revenue. Overall, the campaign had a negative profit of around -3.750€. (This can vary slightly by group dataset). The idea is to develop a model that predicts customer behavior and apply this model to the rest of the customer base. Hopefully the model will allow the company to cherry pick the customers that are most likely to purchase the offer, while leaving out the non-responders, making the next campaign highly profitable.
As said before, the cost per contact is 4€ and the revenue per accepted offer is 20€.

PROJECT “SEGMENTATION”

Objective
The objective of the team in this project is to identify actionable segments within the company’s Customer base. These segments must be identified looking at data available and through the usage of quantitative technics. A priori, two visions are considered important – the customer value segmentation and the product usage segmentation. Nonetheless other perspectives will be valued. The output of this project will be a report identifying the main customer segments and the profile definition of each segment.
